> **Warning**: the project is very much work in progress.

Valves is a collection of functions that for your data `.pipe()`-lines. 

This project aimes to host a few performant implementations of functions that are common in industry. This gives us an opportunity to share sensible implementations but it also allows us to compare the performance across libraries. For now the project mainly targets polars, pandas and dask.
